# A puma at large

## 段落精读
``` A puma at large ```

   * 例句：The mountain lion that killed the hiker was still at large.

```Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America.```

```
When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted 
forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously.
