One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start:the clock was striking the hours!

Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped.

Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on.

You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is working again. ’
```
```
That's the trouble, vicar, ’answered Bill.
```
```
It's working all right, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it. ’
```
```
‘We'll get used to that, Bill, ’said the vicar.
```
* get used to - 习惯于
    * 例句：You'll have to get used to his direct manner.

Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea. ’
