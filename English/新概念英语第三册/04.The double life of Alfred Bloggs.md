# The double life of Alfred Bloggs
```
Why did Alf want a white-collar job?
```
* collar - 衣领
    * white-collar - 白领，脑力劳动者
    * 例句：White-collar workers now work longer hours.
    * blue-collar - 蓝领，体力劳动者
```
These days, people who do manual work often receive far 
more money than people who work in offices.
```
* far more - 许多，多得多
    * 例句：Employees subscribed for far more shares than were available.
* manual - 手工的，靠劳力的
    * 例句：skilled manual workers
```
People who work in offices are frequently referred to as‘white-collar workers' for 
the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. 
```
* refer
    * refer to - 谈及
    * You talk about them or mention them.
    * 例句：In his speech, he referred to a recent trip to Canada.
    * refer to - 描述
    * It describes it in some way.
    * 例句：The term electronics refers to electrically induced action.
```
Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers.
```
* such - 这样的
    * Such位于句首，表示强调，后面用倒装句
* sacrifice - 舍弃
    * 例句：She sacrificed family life to her career.
* privilege - 好处
    * 例句：It must be a privilege to know such a man.
* human nature - 人类本性
```
This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.
```
* give rise to - 导致，引发
    * 例句：Low levels of choline in the body can give rise to high blood pressure.
* curious - 不寻常的，难以理解的
    * 例句：The pageant promises to be a curious mixture of the ancient and modern.
* as it did - 表示前面那句话的情况，就是give rise to curious situations
* in the case of - 在...的情况下
    * 两个合起来就是，导致不寻常的情况在Alfred Bloggs中发生了。
* dustman - 清洁工
```
When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job.
```
```
He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. 
```
```
Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit.
```
* smart - 整洁的
    * 例句：He was smart and well groomed but not good looking.
```
He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman.
```
* change into - 转变
* overalls - 工装裤
```
Before returning home at night, he took a shower and changed back into his suit. 
```
```
Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret.
```
* fellow - 同事
    * 例句：He stood out in terms of competence from all his fellows.
```
Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job.
```
```
He will soon be working in an office. 
```
```
He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that him‘Mr. Bloggs’, not‘Alf’.
```
