# The double life of Alfred Bloggs
```
Why did Alf want a white-collar job?
```
* collar - 衣领
    * white-collar - 白领，脑力劳动者
    * blue-collar - 蓝领，体力劳动者
```
These days, people who do manual work often receive tar 
more money than people who work in offices.
```
* manual - 手工的，靠劳力的
    * 例句：skilled manual workers
```
People who work in offices are frequently referred to as‘white-collar workers' for 
the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work Such is 
human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay 
for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers.
