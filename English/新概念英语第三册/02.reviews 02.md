Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America.
When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been 
spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously.
However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to 
investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have 
seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.
The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking 
blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her.
It immediately ran away when she saw it.
So experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered.
The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning, 
and at another place twenty miles away in the evening.
Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and animals like rabbits.
Paw prints were seen in a number of places, and puma fur was found clinging to bushes.
Several people complained of 'cat-like noise' at night, and a business man on his fishing
trip saw the puma up a tree.
Experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from?
As no pumas had been reported missing from any Zoo in the country, this puma must have been in possesson of private
collector and somehow managed to escape.
The hunt went on for 2 weeks, but the puma was not caught.
It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet contryside.

Our vicar is always raising the money for one cause or another.
But he has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock repaired.
The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged years ago and had been silent ever since.
One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock was strking the hours!
