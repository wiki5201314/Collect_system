# Lesson 6
I have just moved to a new house in Bridge Street.
Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door.
He asked me for a meal and a glass of beer.
In return for this, he stood on his head and sang a song.
I gave him a meal, he ate the food and drank the beer.
Then he put a piece of cheese into his pocket and went away.
Later, my neighbour told me about him:
Everybody knows him, his name is Perty Buttons, he calls at every house in the Street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.

# 错误
* 过去式 - drank / told
* 词语错误 - call at
* 漏了 - once a month
