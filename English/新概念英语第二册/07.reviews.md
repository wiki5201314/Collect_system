# Lesson 6
```
I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street.
Yesterday, a beggar knocked at my door and asked me for a meal and a glass of beer.
In return for this, he stood on his head and sang songs.
I gave him a meal, he ate the food and drank the beer.
Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away.
Later my neighbour told me about him.
Every one knows him, his name is Percy Buttons, he calls at every house in the Street once a month
and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.

# Lesson 5
```
Mr. James Scott has a garage in Silbury and now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst.
Pinhurst is only 5 miles away from Silbury.
But Mr.Scott can not get telephone for his new garage.
So he has just bought 12 pigeons.
Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message from Pinhurst to Silbury.
The bird covered the distance in 3 minutes.
Up to now, Mr.Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other.
In this way, He has begun his own private telephone service.
