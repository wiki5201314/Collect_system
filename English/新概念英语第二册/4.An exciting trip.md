Why is tim finding this trip exciting?

I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim.
He is in Australia.He has been there for 6 months.
Tim is an engineer, he is working for a big firm.
And he has already visited a great number of different places in Australia.
He has just bought an Australian Car.
And he is going to Alice Springs - a small town in the center of Australia.
He will soon visit Darwin, From there he will fly to Perth.
My brother has never been abroad before.
So he is finding this trip very exciting.
