# Lesson 11
```
I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in.
Tony worked in a lawyer's office years ago but now he is working at a bank.
He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back.
Tony saw me and came and sat at the same table.
He has never borrowed money from me.
While he was eating, I asked him to lend me 20 pounds.
To my surprise, he gave the money to me immediately.
"I have never borrowed any money from you"he said"So now You can pay for my dinner."
