# Lesson 11
```
I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in.
Tony worked in a lawyer's office years ago but now he is working at a bank.
He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back.
Tony saw me and came and sat at the same table.
He has never borrowed money from me.
While he was eating, I asked him to lend me 20 pounds.
To my surprise, he gave the money to me immediately.
"I have never borrowed any money from you"he said"So now You can pay for my dinner."

# Lesson 10

Not for jazz

We have an old musical instrument, it is called a clavichord.
It was made in Germany in 1681.
Our clavichord has belonged to my family for a long time.
It is kept in the living room.
The instrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago.
Recently, it was damaged by a visitor.
She tried to play jazz on it.
She stuck the keys too hard and two of the strings were broken.
My father was shocked.
Now, we are not allowed to touch it.
It is being repaired by a friend of my father's.
