# Too late
Did the detectives save the diamonds?

The plane was late, and detectives were waiting for the airport all morning.
They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from South Africa.
A few hours earlier, someone had told the plice that the thieves would try to 
steal the diamonds.
When the plane arrived, someone of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others
were waiting on the airfield.
Two man took the parcel off the plane, and carried it into the Customs house.
While two detectives were keeping guard at the door, two others open the percel.
To their suprise, the precious parcel was full of stones and sand?
