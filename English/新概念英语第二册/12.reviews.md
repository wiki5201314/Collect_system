A cold welcome

On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall.
It was the last day of the year, a large crowd of people had gathered
under the Town Hall clock.
It would strike twelve in 20 minutes' time.
Fifteen minutes passed and then at five to tweleve, the clock stopped.
The big minute hand did not move.
We waited and waited but nothing happened.
Suddenly, somebody shouted: It is 2 minutes past twelve, the clock has stopped.
I looked at the watch, it was true.
The big clock refused to welcome the New Year.
At that moment, everbody began to laugh and sing.

Not for jazz

We have an old musical instrument, it is called a clavichord.
It was made in Germany in 1681.
Our clavichord is kept in the living room.
It has belonged to our family for a long time.
The instrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago.
Recently, it was damaged by a visitor.
She tried to play jazz on it.
She struck the keys too hard, and two the strings were broken.
My father was shocked.
Now, we are not allowed to touch it.
It is being repaired by a friend of my father's.
