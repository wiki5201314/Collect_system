# Lesson 10
```
We have an old musical instrument, it is called a clavichord.
It was made in Germany in 1681.
Our clavichord is kept in the living room.
It has belonged to our family for a long time.
The insrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago.
Recently, it was damaged by a visitor.
She tried to play jazz on it.
She stuck the keys too hard and two of the strings were broken.
My father was shocked.
Now, we are not allowed to touch it.
It is being repaired by a friend of my father's.

# Lesson 9
```
On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall.
It was the last day of the year and a large crowd of people had gethered 
under the Town Hall clock.
It would strike 12 in 20 minutes' time.
15 minutes passed and then at 5 to 12, the clock stopped.
The big minute hand did not moved.
We waited and waited, but nothing happened.
Suddenly, somebody shouted: it is 2 minutes past 12, the clock has stopped.
I looked at the watch, it was true.
The big clock refused to welcome the New Year.
At the moment, people began to laugh and sing.
