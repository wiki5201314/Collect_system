We have an old musical instrument, it is called a clavichord.
It was made in Germany in 1681.
Our clavichrod is kept in the living room.
It has belonged to our family for a long time.
The instrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago.
Recently it was damaged by a visitor.
She tried to play jazz on it.
She struck the keys too hard, and two of the strings were broken.
My father was shocked.
Now, we are not allowed to touch it.
It is being repaired by a friend of my father's.

Yesterday, a beggar knocked at my door and asked me for a meal and a glass of beer.
In return of this, he stood on his head and sang a song.
I gave him a meal, he ate the food and drank the beer.
Then he put a piece of cheese into his pocket and went away.
Later, my neighbour told my about him.
