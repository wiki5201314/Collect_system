# Review Lesson 11
```
I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in.
He worked in a lawyer's office years ago but he is now
working at a bank.
He gets a good salary but he always borrows money from his friends
and never pays it back.
Tony saw me and came and sat at the same table.
He has never borrowed money from me.
While he was eating, I asked him to lend me 20 pounds.
To me surprise, he gave me the money immediately.
"I have never borrowed any money from you" He said,
"so now you can pay for my dinner."

# Dictation Lesson 12

Where is captain Alison going and how?

Our neighbour, Captain Charles Alison will sail from Portsmouth tomorrow. 
we'll meet him at the harbour early in the morning.
He will be in his small boat, Topsail.
Topsail is a famous little boat.
It has sailed across Atlantic many times.
Captain aleson will set out at 8 o'clock.
So we'll have plenty of time.
we'll see his boat and then we'll say goodbye to him.
He will be away for 2 months.
We are very proud of him.
He will take part in an important race across the Atlantic.
