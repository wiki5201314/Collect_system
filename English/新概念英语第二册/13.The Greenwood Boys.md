# Review Lesson 12

Goodbye and good luck

Our neighbour, Captain Charles Alison will sail from Portsmouth tomorrow.
We'll meet him at the harbour early in the morning.
He will be in his small boat, Topsail.
Topsail is a famous little boat, it has sailed across the Atlantic many times.
Captain Alison will set out at 8 o'clock.
So we'll have plenty of time, we'll see his boat and then we'll say goodbye to him.
He will be away for 2 months.
We are very proud of him.
He will take part in an important race across the Atlantic.

# Review Lesson 11

One good turn deserves another

I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in.
He worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but now he is working at a bank.
He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back.
He saw me and came and sat at the same table.
He has never borrowed money from me.
While he was eating, I asked him to lend me 20 pounds.
To my surprise, he gave me the money immediately.
"I have never borrow any money from you." He said, 
"So now you can pay for my dinner."

Why will the police have a difficult time?

The Greenwood Boys are a group of pop singers.
At present, they are visiting all parts of the country.
They will be arriving here tomorrow.
They will be coming by train and most of the young people in the town
will be meeting them at the station.
Tomorrow evening they will be singing at the Workers' Club.
The Greenwood Boys will be staying for five days.
During this time, they will give five performances.
As usual, the police will have a difficult time.
They will be trying to keep order.
It is always the same on these occasions.
