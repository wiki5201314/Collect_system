# Lesson 11
```
I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tom Steele came in.
He worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working 
at a bank.
He gets a good salary, but he always borrowed money from his 
friends and never pays it back.
He saw me and came and sat at the same table.
He has never borrowed money from me.
When he was eating, I asked him to lent me 20 pounds.
To my surprise, he gave me the money immediately.
"I have never borrowed any money from you, "He said,
"So now you can pay for my dinner."
