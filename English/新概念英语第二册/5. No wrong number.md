I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim.
He is in Australia. He has been there for 6 months.
Tim is an engineer. He is working for a big firm and he has already 
visited a great number of different places in Australia.
He has just bought an Austrlian car and has gone to Alice Spring, 
a small town in the centre of Australia.
Then he will soon visit Darwin, from there, he will fly to Perth.
My brother has never been abroad before,
so he is finding this trip very exciting.
