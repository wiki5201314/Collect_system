Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town.
Nearly everybody enters for "The Nicest Garden Competition" each year.
But Joe wins every time.
Bill Firth's garden is larger than Joe's.
Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables.
But Joe's garden is more interesting.
He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool.
I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work.
Every year I enter for the garden competition too.
But I always win a little prize of the worst garden in the town

What does a cold welcome refer to?

On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall.
It was the last day of the year and a large crowd of people had gathered 
under The Town Hall clock.
It would strike 12 in 20 minutes time.
15 minutes passed and then at 5 to 12, the clock stopped.
The big minute hand did not moved.
We waited and waited but nothing happened.
Suddenly, someone shouted: It's 2 minutes passed 12.The clock has stopped.
I looked at my watch, it was true.
The big clock refused to welcome the New Year.
At that moment, everybody began to laugh and sing.
