## Review Lesson 12
```
Our neighbour, Captain Charles Alison will sail from Portsmouth tomorrow.
We'll meet him at the harbour early in the morning.
He will be in his small boat, Topsail.
Topsail is a famous little boat, it has sailed across the Atlantic many times.
He will set out at 8 o'clock.
So we'll have plenty of time.
We'll see his boat and then say goodbye to him.
We are very proud of him.
He will be away for 2 months.
He will take part in an important race across the Atlantic.
