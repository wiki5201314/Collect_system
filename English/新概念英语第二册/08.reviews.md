Nearly everybody enters for "The Nicest Garden Competition" each year.
but Joe wins every time.
Bill Firth's Garden is larger than Joe's.
Bill work harder than Joe, and grows more flowers and vegetables.
But Joe's gargen is more interesting.
He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool.
I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work.
Every year I enter for the garden competiton too,
and I always win a little prize of the wrost garden in the town!

Lesson 7
```
The plane was late.
The detectives was waiting at the airport all morning.
