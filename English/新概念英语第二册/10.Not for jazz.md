On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall.
It was the last day of the year, and a large crowd people had gathered under the Town Hall clock.
The clock would strike 12 in 20 minutes' time.
15 minutes passed and then at 5 to 12, the clock stopped.
The big minute hand did not move.
We were waiting and waiting, but nothing happened.
Suddenly someone shouted: "It is 2 minutes past 12, the clock has stopped."
I looked at my watch, it was true.
The big clock refused to welcome the New Year.
At that moment, everybody began to laugh and sing.

Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town.
Nearly everybody enters for "the Nicest Garden Competition" each year.
But Joe wins every time.
Bill Firth's garden is larger than Joe's.
Bill works hard than Joe, and grows more flowers and vegetables.
But Joe's garden is more interesting.
He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool.
I like gardens but I did not like hard work.
Every year, I enter for the garden competition too, 
but I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town.
