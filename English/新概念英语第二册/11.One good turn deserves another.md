Who paid for Tony's dinner?

I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in.
Tony worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working at a bank.
He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends
and never pays it back.
Tony saw me and came and sat at the same table.
While he was wating, I asked him to lend me twenty pounds.
To my surprise, he gave me the money immediately.
I have never borrowed any money from you. Tony said
so now you can pay for my dinner!
