Who paid for Tony's dinner?

I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in.
Tony worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working at a bank.
He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends
and never pays it back.
Tony saw me and came and sat at the same table.
While he was wating, I asked him to lend me twenty pounds.
To my surprise, he gave me the money immediately.
I have never borrowed any money from you. Tony said
so now you can pay for my dinner!

We have an old musical instrument, it is called clavichord.
It was made in Germany in 1681.
It is kept in the living room.
Our clavichord has belonged to my family for a long time.
The instrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago.
Recently, it was damaged by a visitor.
She tried to play jazz on it.
She struck the keys too hard and two of the strings were broken.
My father was shocked.
Now, we are not allowed to touch it.
It is being repaired by a friend of my father's.
