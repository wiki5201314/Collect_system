# The question

When the veteran manager finished reading The One Minute Manager, 
he put the book down on his coffee table.He leaned back with a questioning look.
He had first read the book at the office but had brought it home to give it 
another reading.

"Even after a second time through," he thought to himself, "I can't argue with
the logic of three secrets of the One Minute Manager. But if I practice them,
will I actually become a more prouctive manager?"

The veteran manager decided to do something about his question. The next morning
he would call a manager in a town a few hours away who had, in recent years, turned
a troublesome company into a very profitable enterprise.The veteran had read a newspaper
interview with this manager in which he had credited much of his success to practicing 
One Minute Management.In fact, he now called himself a "One Minute Manager."

# The One Minute Manager
The next morning when the veteran manager got to his office, he called the new One
Minute Manager.He introduced himself and asked the manager if he could see him sometime
that week and talk about One Minute Management. The veteran had been warned what the 
answer might be but he was still surprised when the One Minute Manager actually said,
"Come anytime except Wednesday morning. That's when I meet with my key people. To be honest
with you, I don't have much else scheduled this week. You pick the time."

"I'll be over tomorrow morning at ten, " said the veteran manager, chuckling to himself.
When he hung up the phone he thought, "This ought to be interesting. I'm sure I'll get my
questions ansewered."

When the veteran manager arrived st the One Minute Manager's office, the secretary said,
"he's expecting you. Go right in."

As he entered the room, he found a man in his late forties standing by the window looking out.

The vateran manager coughed and the One Minute Manager looked up. He smiled and 
said, "Good to see you. Let's sit down over here." He led the manager to a conversation
area in the corner of the room.

"Well, what can I do for you?" the One Minute Manager asked as he sat down.

"I have read The One Minute Manager and so have my people, "the veteran manager
began."I'm enthusiastic right now and so are they, but that has happened before
when a new management system has been introduced.My question is how do you put
One Minute Management to work in a way that turns the secrets into usable skills
 and makes a difference where it really counts - in performace?"
